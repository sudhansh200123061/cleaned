optoisol interfac question   interfac simpl circuit run v cpu board run v optoisol n led side put signal want k resistor base n transistor side tie cpu input line collector pull resistor k  function ok seem slow detect pul occur khz much faster rise fall time devic someth like u abl detect target khz get khz done use wire wrap wire go cpu test pin inch long anyth high speed  art electron mention tie base phototransistor ground resistor improv speed need calcul resistor valu     paul malenf
